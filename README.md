## Description

This repository contains three versions of our On-Screen Keyboard, each representing a stage of our learning and creativity:

### Version 1: Beginner's Keyboard 🚧

In Version 1, we had just started learning about web development, resulting in a simple and rough keyboard design. This version reflects our initial exploration and experimentation with HTML and CSS.

### Version 2: Enhanced Themes and Functionality 🎨

Version 2 marks a significant improvement in our skills and understanding. We explored different themes and added more functionality to the keyboard. This version includes both AZERTY and QWERTY layouts, various font styles, and color themes. Additionally, we introduced an "About Us" page and a feedback section to enhance user interaction.

### Version 3: Creative Innovation 🌟

In Version 3, we pushed the boundaries of creativity and innovation. This final version showcases unique and innovative ideas, setting it apart from the previous versions. The keyboard design and features are entirely distinct, demonstrating our growth and imagination.
